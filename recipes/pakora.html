     <p><h1>Description</h1></p>
     <p><strong>
        These vegetable pakoras are delicious. You'll love this recipe if you've ever had Japanese tempura-coated veggies. These pakoras are similar, but the spiced batter gives them a unique taste. Serve with chili sauce, mint yogurt sauce, or sweet and sour sauce. Try this recipe with other vegetables, such as sweet potatoes, broccoli, and asparagus.
